# kubectl krew template repo

## Make it yours

Next, this is a Go project, so there are some import paths, binaries and a few things that need to be renamed. All open your locally-cloned repo in your favorite editor, and search/replace a couple of terms:  

(Be sure to do a case sensitive search)

`OWNER`: replace this with the github username or the org name that your repo belongs in.
`REPO`: replace this with the repo name that you've created
`PLUGIN`: replace this with the name of your plugin/binary (many times this is the repo name)

docs/USAGE.md: Give it a quick scan and update it.
